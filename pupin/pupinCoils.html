        <p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", 
        followed closely on the pioneering work of the English physicist and 
        mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some 
        seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the American
         rights to it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T),
          making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made 
          little use of it, as they already had their own development in hand 
          led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin 
        with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of 
        an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly 
        extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
